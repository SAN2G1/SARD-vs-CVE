Condor Contrib - PIGEON 

1 - Building:
--------------

For making your life easier, make sure you have the Condor source tree checked out. Then add this folder (condor_addons_pigeon) under src/.
Now you can run condor_imake , make, make release, make clean .. etc.

One important point is, though, that you have to indicate where your QPid installation is located by setting the environment variable "QPID_INSTALL". make will check whether you did or not. 


2 - Running:
-------------

Edit the condor_config_addon file and adapt the paths to what fits your needs. Add this guy to the LOCAL_CONFIG_FILE.

Now you should be good to go and be able to run the daemon
	condor_pigeon

Make sure you have QPID_INSTALL/lib and CONDOR_RELEASE_DIR/lib in your LD_LIBRARY_PATH when doing so.
