Dependencies

ssh

Condor (on remote machine)

Description
-----------
Remote Condor allows a user to submit and monitor batch jobs through a remote
instance of Condor from his or her computer without having to install
Condor locally.

Installation
------------
From the rcondor/src directory as root run:

make install

By default the root of installation is /usr/local.
To specify a different root specify it in the prefix variable when running
make.  e.g.:

make prefix=/some/other/location install

to uninstall:
make uninstall

Configuration
-------------
after installing, run:
rcondor_configure user@host:dir mountpoint

These argument fields should correspond to your standard sshfs mount command.

It will create a file:
$HOME/.rcondor/rcondor.conf

with the lines:
USR_HOST = user@host
LOCAL = mountpoint
REMOTE = dir
 
Usage
-----
Once rcondor.conf is properly configured, run:

rcondor_mnt

Make sure that any paths corresponding to job executables, submit files, and job
output files are located somewhere within the LOCAL path specified in
rcondor.conf.  Also make sure your current working directory is within the
LOCAL path.

Then run a command such as 

condor_submit 

followed by the usual arguments.

The following commands are currently available:
condor_submit
condor_rm
condor_q
condor_status
