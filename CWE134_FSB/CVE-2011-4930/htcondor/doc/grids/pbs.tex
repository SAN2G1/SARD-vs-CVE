The popular PBS (Portable Batch System) comes in
several varieties: OpenPBS (\URL{http://www.openpbs.org}),
PBS Pro (\URL{http://www.altair.com/software/pbspro.htm}), and
Torque
(\URL{http://www.clusterresources.com/pages/products/torque-resource-manager.php}).

Condor jobs are submitted to a local PBS system
using the \SubmitCmd{grid} universe and the
\SubmitCmd{grid\_resource} command by placing the following
into the submit description file.
\begin{verbatim}
grid_resource = pbs
\end{verbatim}

The pbs grid type requires two variables to be set in the Condor
configuration file.
\Macro{PBS\_GAHP} is the path to the PBS GAHP server binary that is to be
used to submit PBS jobs.
\Macro{GLITE\_LOCATION} is the path to the directory containing the GAHP's
configuration file and auxillary binaries.
In the Condor distribution, these files are located in 
\File{\MacroUNI{LIB}/glite}.
The PBS GAHP's configuration file is in
\File{\MacroUNI{GLITE\_LOCATION}/etc/batch\_gahp.config}.
The PBS GAHP's auxillary binaries
are to be in the directory \File{\MacroUNI{GLITE\_LOCATION}/bin}.
The Condor configuration file appears

\footnotesize
\begin{verbatim}
GLITE_LOCATION = $(LIB)/glite
PBS_GAHP       = $(GLITE_LOCATION)/bin/batch_gahp
\end{verbatim}
\normalsize

The PBS GAHP's configuration file contains two variables that must be
modified to tell it where to find PBS on the local system.
\MacroNI{pbs\_binpath} is the directory that contains the PBS binaries.
\MacroNI{pbs\_spoolpath} is the PBS spool directory.
