\Description

\Condor{drain} is an administrative command used to control draining
of an execute machine.  Once the startd is draining, it will not
accept any new jobs.  How existing jobs are treated depends on the
draining schedule that is chosen:

\begin{description}

\item[\Opt{-graceful}] Initiate a graceful eviction of the job.  This means
all promises that have been made to the job are honored, including
\MacroNI{MaxJobRetirementTime}.  The eviction of jobs is coordinated
to reduce idle time.  This means if one slot has a job with a long
retirement time and the other slots have jobs with shorter retirement
times, the effective retirement time for all of the jobs is the longer
one.  If no draining schedule is specified, \Opt{-graceful} is chosen
by default.

\item[\Opt{-quick}] \MacroNI{MaxJobRetirementTime} is not honored.  Eviction
of jobs is immediately initiated.  Jobs are given time to shut down
and checkpoint according to the usual policy
(i.e. \MacroNI{MachineMaxVacateTime}).

\item[\Opt{-fast}] Jobs are immediately hard-killed with no chance to
gracefully shut down or checkpoint.

\end{description}

Once draining is complete, the machine will enter the Drained/Idle
state.  To resume normal operation at this time or any previous time
during draining, the \Opt{-cancel} option may be used.  To
automatically resume normal operation once draining has completed, the
\Opt{-resume-on-completion} option may be used when initiating
draining.  This is useful for forcing a machine with a partitionable
slot to join all of the resources back together into one slot.

\begin{Options}
  \OptItem{\Opt{-help}}{ Display brief usage information and exit. }
  \ToolDebugDesc
  \OptItem{\OptArg{-pool}{pool-name}}{Specify an alternate Condor pool,
    if the default one is not desired.}
  \OptItem{\Opt{-graceful}}{(the default) Honor maximum vacate and retirement time policy}
  \OptItem{\Opt{-quick}}{Honor maximum vacate but not retirement time policy}
  \OptItem{\Opt{-fast}}{Honor neither maximum vacate nor retirement time policy}
  \OptItem{\Opt{-resume-on-completion}}{When done draining, resume normal operation}
  \OptItem{\OptArg{-check}{expr}}{Abort if expression is not true for all slots to be drained}
  \OptItem{\Opt{-cancel}}{Cancel a prior draining request}
  \OptItem{\OptArg{-request-id}{id}}{Specify a specific drainng request to cancel}
\end{Options}

\ExitStatus

\Condor{drain} will exit with a non-zero status value if it fails and
zero status if it succeeds.
